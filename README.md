# BatteryParsing_DataEngineeringProject
This project focused on parsing and feature engineering a battery cycle data set to produce a plot. This project was completed in Python utilizing NumPy, pandas, 
and Matplotlib libraries. Jupyter Notebook was used as an IDE for the initial data exploration and then a class Battery_Cycle_MaxCapacity with methods to parse the data and create the plot was designed.

# Use Case
Shown below is the plot produced from the data set.
